# RDK-video-export
exporting RDK(Random Dot Kinematogram) to webm, gif, etc. using ccapture.

# Usage
Downlaod and open index.html with your browser that supports canvas tag. And just click 'Start Capture' button on left bottom corner.
Basically, after 3 seconds(taking 180 frames) clicking the button, automatically downloads the captured video as webm format.
I'm suggesting you convert it to other formats you want.
You can control the options not only about rdk, but capturing with index.js file. 
Check variable definitions on top of source file.
